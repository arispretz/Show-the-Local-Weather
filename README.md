# Show-the-Local-Weather
This is one of my projects in the way to achieve "Legacy Front End" certification at freeCodeCamp.org. It was designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.

Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.

User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

Note: Many internet browsers now require an HTTP Secure (https://) connection to obtain a user's locale via HTML5 Geolocation. For this reason, we recommend using HTML5 Geolocation to get user location and then use the freeCodeCamp Weather API https://weather-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/ which uses an HTTP Secure connection for the weather. Also, be sure to connect to CodePen.io via https://.
